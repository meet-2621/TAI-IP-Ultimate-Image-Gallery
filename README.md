# TAI-IP-Ultimate-Image-Gallery
I recently built an Ultimate Image Gallery, but it became more than a coding exercise. Each feature â€” filtering, searching, favorites, themes â€” was a lesson in making technology intuitive and human-centered. Excited to keep building projects where design meets functionality. ðŸš€  #WebDevelopment #FrontendDevelopment #LearningByBuilding
